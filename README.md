# SNHU Computer Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Southern New Hampshire University Computer Science portfolio. This repository showcases my coursework and growth throughout the Computer Science program. Each branch in this repository represents a specific course and contains projects, reflections, and artifacts that demonstrate the skills I’ve developed so far as a software developer.

## Repository Structure

- **main** – Overview of my portfolio and reflection on my overall learning journey.
- **CS210** – Programming Languages: Focused on C++ program design, file I/O, and problem-solving. Includes projects such as Airgead Banking and Corner Grocer, which demonstrate practical programming and data analysis skills.
- **CS250** – Software Development Lifecycle: Highlights my experience using Agile and Scrum methodologies, including sprint reviews, retrospectives, and software development planning.

Additional branches will be added as I progress through the program.

## Reflection

My time at SNHU so far has taught me not just how to code, but how to think like a developer. In CS 210, I learned how to write efficient, well-documented code and solve problems logically using C++. In CS 250, I gained hands-on experience with Agile and Scrum practices, learning the importance of teamwork, iteration, and continuous improvement. This portfolio will continue to grow as I complete new courses and build on these foundations toward a career in software engineering.
