# CS 250 Module Eight Journal

This repository includes my Sprint Review and Retrospective deliverable from the final project for CS 250. This artifact demonstrates my understanding of Agile and Scrum practices and how they apply to software development in a collaborative environment. Below are my reflections on the essential questions for the Computer Science program.

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I interpret user needs by focusing on the purpose behind their requests rather than just the features they describe. Creating user stories helps with this because it captures the user’s goals from their perspective—who they are, what they want to do, and why it matters. This approach keeps development centered on solving real problems and ensures that each feature adds meaningful value for the user.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach program development by breaking projects into smaller, manageable tasks that can be built, tested, and refined over time. Agile processes like sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives create structure and allow for quick adjustments based on feedback. In the future, I plan to keep using short feedback loops, continuous integration, and incremental delivery to maintain flexibility and consistent progress throughout development.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means communicating clearly, staying accountable, and supporting others. It also means being open to feedback, respecting different perspectives, and focusing on the team’s overall success instead of individual recognition. Collaboration and trust are key in building quality software, and I believe a strong team culture leads to stronger products.
