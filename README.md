# CS 210 Portfolio Submission – Programming Languages

This branch contains my selected project from CS 210: Programming Languages at Southern New Hampshire University. The project demonstrates my ability to design, develop, and document a functional C++ program that meets industry standards. It highlights my growth in writing efficient, secure, and well-structured code.

## Project Summary

The project I selected for my portfolio is the **Corner Grocer** program. It was designed to help a small grocery store analyze and track item frequency from a text record of sales. The goal was to build a program that could read data from a file, count the occurrences of each item, and present the results both in text form and as a simple histogram. This project focused on applying fundamental programming concepts in a practical way using C++.

## Reflection

### What did I do particularly well?
I believe I did a great job organizing the code into clear, logical functions and keeping it well-documented. I also handled file input and output efficiently, ensuring the program ran smoothly and accurately displayed results for any input file. The histogram output turned out clean and easy to read, which improved user experience.

### Where could I enhance my code?
If I were to improve the program, I would add better input validation and error handling for edge cases, such as empty files or invalid entries. I would also consider using a map or unordered_map to make the frequency lookup more efficient, improving runtime on larger datasets.

### Which pieces were most challenging, and how did I overcome them?
The most challenging part was managing file paths and making sure the program could handle data read from text files properly. I overcame this by reviewing C++ file I/O documentation, using testing data, and debugging step by step. I also learned to use descriptive error messages to identify where things went wrong.

### What tools or resources did I add to my support network?
I relied on the C++ reference site, my course materials, and Visual Studio’s debugging tools. I also began using GitHub for version control, which helped me back up my work and track changes more efficiently.

### What skills are transferable to other projects or coursework?
This project reinforced my understanding of data structures, loops, conditionals, and file handling — all essential for future programming and software engineering courses. The ability to plan, document, and test code thoroughly will also be valuable in larger projects.

### How did I make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I used consistent naming conventions, clear comments, and modular functions to make the program easy to follow. Each function performs one clear task, which makes future changes or expansions simpler. The program can also be adapted easily by updating the input file or extending the logic for different data analysis needs.
